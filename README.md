# MathMatrix
MathMatrix is a Java class that models systems of linear equations (math matrices) commonly used in linear algebra. It allows you to perform various operations on matrices, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, scaling, transposition, and checking if a matrix is upper triangular.

# Features:
Create a MathMatrix from a 2D array or with specified dimensions and an initial value.
Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
Get a scaled version of the matrix.
Compute the transpose of the matrix.
Check if the matrix is upper triangular.
Implement methods for deep copying and rectangular matrix checking.

# Usage:
To use the MathMatrix class, you can instantiate objects and call its methods to perform matrix operations. You can create MathMatrix objects from 2D arrays or specify dimensions and initial values. Then, use the methods like add(), subtract(), multiply(), getScaledMatrix(), and getTranspose() for various matrix operations. The class also provides a toString() method to display the matrix as a string.

# How to Use:
Instantiate a MathMatrix object using the provided constructors.
Perform matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, or multiplication by calling the respective methods.
Get a scaled version of the matrix or its transpose as needed.
Check if the matrix is upper triangular.
Display the matrix using the toString() method.
Feel free to explore the code for additional methods and implementation details.
This MathMatrix class is designed for educational purposes and can be a valuable tool for understanding and working with matrices in Java.
